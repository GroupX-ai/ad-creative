# ESA Card | where each asset has been published

One row per asset per platform. Update this when anything ships, so nobody re-uploads a clip
that is already live or launches a duplicate ad.

## The shippable set

- **20 banners**, `2026-08-14-spelled-out/p*.png`. The acronym is spelled out in full
  everywhere except inside the domain.
- **10 videos**, `2026-08-14-approved/d*-captioned.mp4` and
  `2026-08-14-batch2/e*-captioned.mp4`. Vertical 9:16, 720p, 15 seconds, burned one-word
  captions.
- **5 extra videos**, `2026-08-14-spelled-out/c*-captioned.mp4`. A different register (one
  person talking to a phone) rather than the slice-of-life formula Robby approved. Held in
  reserve, not part of the ten.

## YouTube

Channel: **ESA Card**, connected through Postiz (integration `cmsrzf7y402wmqb0ybqllpkdl`).

All ten uploaded 2026-08-13, public, `selfDeclaredMadeForKids: no`. Uploaded as vertical
15-second clips, so they land as Shorts.

| clip | title |
| --- | --- |
| `d1-viewing` | Fourth viewing this month. It used to take a week. |
| `d2-lobby` | The lobby question I used to dread |
| `d3-bench` | I used to stand in the street explaining her |
| `d4-section-four` | Rental application, section four |
| `d5-hotel` | Checking in with the dog. No phone calls, no forms. |
| `e1-first-day` | His first day at daycare |
| `e2-keys` | Keys to our first flat |
| `e3-back-sunday` | Back Sunday. He has already stolen the sofa. |
| `e4-cottage` | Six hours in the car for this |
| `e5-haircut` | His first ever haircut |

Every description carries the same three blocks: the clip's own opening line, the offer
(certificate and ID card, verifiable registration number, $39 one time, no subscription), and
the honesty block required by `docs/ads/policy.md` in the `esacard.com` repo. No description
claims a housing, landlord, airline or access outcome.

**Why this matters beyond the channel:** a Google Ads video campaign can only run creative
that already lives on YouTube. These ten being public is the precondition for that campaign,
not just a content play.

### Uploading more later

Postiz only accepts media from a public URL, and these files are local. The route that works
is fal's storage API: `POST https://rest.alpha.fal.ai/storage/upload/initiate` with
`{content_type, file_name}` returns `{file_url, upload_url}`, then `PUT` the bytes to
`upload_url`. `file_url` is public and Postiz's `uploadFromUrlTool` accepts it.

## Launched 2026-08-13

Four platforms live, **$98/day combined** (about $2,980/month). Robby's only stated budget
was $1,000/month for Google, and the Google half holds to it exactly ($33/day). The Meta and
Reddit numbers are chosen, not sanctioned, and are the first thing to cut.

| platform | campaign | daily | optimising for | creative |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Google Search | `ESA Card \| Search \| US \| Core` | $23 | Purchase (site tag) | 3 RSAs, ~70 keywords |
| Google Demand Gen | `ESA Card \| Demand Gen \| US \| YouTube` | $10 | Purchase (site tag) | 2 ads × 5 YouTube clips |
| Meta | `ESA Card \| Meta \| US \| Cold \| Sales` | $50 | InitiateCheckout | 20 images + 10 videos |
| Reddit | `ESA Card \| Reddit \| Pet + Housing \| Launch` | $15 | PageVisit | 20 images + 10 videos |

### Why nothing optimises for Purchase except Google

Meta and Reddit both need roughly 50 optimisation events per week to leave the learning
phase. Break-even is **$37.57** per purchase, so 50 a week is about $1,878 a week, far above
this budget. A Purchase-optimised ad set would sit in learning indefinitely and deliver
badly. See `docs/ads/meta-ads.md` section 3 in the `esacard.com` repo.

`Purchase` is still **measured** everywhere, browser and server. Optimisation target and
success metric are different things: the success metric is always cost per purchase against
$37.57, reconciled against Stripe as the system of record.

Google Search is the exception and legitimately optimises for Purchase, because search
intent is narrow enough that the conversion action can carry the campaign.

### Reddit is a bootstrap, not a real conversion campaign

Reddit's API **refuses** `PURCHASE`, `ADD_TO_CART`, `VIEW_CONTENT` and `LANDING_PAGE_VISIT`
as optimisation goals on this account: "Conversion goal(optimization goal) is not valid for
Conversions Campaigns". Confirmed cause, not a guess. `GET /pixels/{id}/last_fired_at`
returns:

```
page_visit   2026-08-13T21:35:19Z
purchase     null
add_to_cart  null
view_content null
sign_up      null
```

Reddit will only let you optimise for an event its pixel has actually seen, and `page_visit`
is the only one. The ad group is therefore named as a bootstrap and must be **rebuilt on
Purchase once real events land** (the goal is immutable after creation, so it is a rebuild,
not an edit). The two earlier clicks-optimised ad groups are archived.

### Tracking state

| | state |
| --- | --- |
| Meta pixel `4305407809789395` | live and firing, confirmed by `last_fired_time` |
| Meta Conversions API | token set in Vercel, not fired yet (no purchase since) |
| TikTok pixel `D9V1HSBC77UBUCS23800` | live, production only |
| TikTok Events API | token set in Vercel, not fired yet |
| Reddit pixel | only `page_visit` has ever fired |
| Google conversion | `ESA Purchase (site tag)`, `AW-18387903752 / Y4F_CN7rlOEcEIjKhMBE`, primary |

### Known gaps at launch

1. **No Instagram account is linked to the Meta ad account.** `instagram_accounts` returns
   empty, so the ads are Facebook-only. The ten videos are vertical 9:16 and were built for
   Reels and Stories, which is the single best surface they have. Connecting the Instagram
   account is the highest-value unblock on Meta.
2. **Domain verification for `esacard.com` is not done** on Meta (Business Settings → Brand
   Safety → Domains) or TikTok (Business Center → Assets → Domains).
3. **The ESA Card Facebook Page has 0 fans and no posts.** A page with no content is a
   review risk and hurts credibility on click-through.
4. **Special ad category is declared as none.** ESA Card sells a pet product, not a housing
   opportunity, so that is correct, but some creative depicts leasing offices and rental
   forms. If Meta disagrees, this is where a disapproval will come from.

## TikTok

Deferred by Robby to a separate conversation with the TikTok Ads connector. The self-contained
prompt is in `esacard/TIKTOK-HANDOFF.md`.

## Two API facts worth keeping

- **Reddit ad `type` is `UNSPECIFIED`, not `PROMOTED_USER_POST`.** The value in
  `_scripts/reddit-launch-bitpredict.mjs` is wrong; that script never reached its own
  activation step, so it was never caught. All 30 posts were created before the ads failed.
- **Reddit updates are `PATCH /ad_groups/{id}`**, with no `/ad_accounts/{id}` prefix. The
  prefixed path 404s. Same script, same latent bug.
- **Google removed `VIDEO_ACTION` campaigns in API v25.** Video-for-conversions is now
  Demand Gen (`advertising_channel_type: DEMAND_GEN`), whose targeting lives on the ad group,
  not the campaign, and which requires `contains_eu_political_advertising`.
